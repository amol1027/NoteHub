2.  **Set up your web server:**
    This project is designed to run on a PHP-compatible web server (e.g., Apache with XAMPP).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    Import the `justclick.sql` file located in the `database/` directory into your MySQL database.

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    Ensure your PHP files (e.g., `admin/admin_login.php`, `student/login.php`) are configured to connect to your MySQL database. You might need to adjust database credentials.
